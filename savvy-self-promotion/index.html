						<h2 style="font-size: 53px; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether you're just starting out or have been freelancing for years,</h2> <h2 style="margin-top: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 40px; line-height: 20px;">knowing the art of self promotion is important to keep your business moving forward.</span></h2>
						<p>Some designers focus on self promotion more than others, but smart freelancers know their audience and where they hang out. It's important to reach out to clients consistently and follow up on warm leads. Sharing useful information, staying visible, publishing your work, and asking for the project should be top priority.</p>

						<p>All too often freelancers get busy and forget to market themselves leaving themselves high and dry with no work. Eventually freelancers end up scrambling to get work by taking projects they're not comfortable with just to pay the bills. Long term, taking on unwanted projects isn't healthy for your business and may take focus away from your primary business goals.</p>

You'll look back over time and wonder why you didn't develop a system sooner. We're all so busy with work and looking ahead to new projects, but there are few things more important to long term success than consistent self promotion. </p>
