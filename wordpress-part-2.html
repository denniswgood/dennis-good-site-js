        <h2>Plugins</h2>
        <p><strong>What are plugins?</strong> Plugins are pieces of code that add functionality to your WordPress site. Developers create plugins to increase security, enhance your HTML editor or to reduce spam on your blog. They can be created to add about any type of functionality to your website and can reduce time spent by a developer manually coding functionality into your site. The WordPress library is extensive and can be searched right within your plugins area in your WordPress Dashboard. You also have the option to upload your own or a plugin bought from another website. </p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage my plugins?</strong> Plugins are the fifth item down under appearance. The plugins page gives you the option to Add New or to manage the existing plugins you have installed. When managing your installed plugins, you have the options to Activate, Deactivate, Update or Delete. When adding new, you have the option to search for a plugin or upload your own. You have a lot of options with searching such as featured, popular, newest and favorites. If you find a plugin that works for you, you have the option of clicking Install Now right from the search results page. This will install of the needed files for this plugin. Once the files are installed you will be given the option to activate the plugin. </p>
        <p><strong>A few helpful tips.</strong> Too many plugins can be a lot to manage. WordPress is update frequently, which means your plugins need to be updated as well. Having too many plugins to maintain for your site can end up being a maintenance nightmare. Use only the plugins that you need and make sure they receive good reviews and are from a reputable developer. Plugins that are not properly developed can cause problems with your site, so proceeed with caution and use only the best plugins.
        </p>
        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p><strong>What are themes?</strong> Themes contain the styles for your site and have specific functionality built in specially for that theme. They determine the look and feel of your site and sometimes offer a theme manager right within WordPress. Themes also determine what widgets are available for the footer and sidebar and how your menus are managed. They can range from very simple with limited functionality to very complex depending on what needs the theme developer is trying to address. As with plugins, if you're purchasing a theme or downloading it from a developer, be sure that it's a quality theme and is supported in case you have questions or concerns. </p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage my themes?</strong> WordPress typically comes with a few pre-installed themes. They are great themes if you're just getting the hang of WordPress. You search themes right within WordPress and select by color, columns, layout, features, etc. Over time, more and more developers are creating themes in all shapes and colors, so there is a lot to choose from. Research other theme Marketplaces such as Theme Forest to give yourself a wider variety to choose from. You can also select the Upload tab to upload a theme you've purchased from another developer or your own theme if you're a developer and have created your own theme.</p>
        <p><strong>A few helpful tips.</strong> Purchasing a theme is fine if you're not looking for a custom look or special functionality. If you're looking for something unique to your brand and a one of a kind you'll need to look into custom WordPress development. WordPress themes you purchase through a Marketplace can be a one size fits all theme with all of the bells and whistles. You may not need all of this functionality and may have simpler needs for your business. Typically a custom theme will be leaner and geared to your personal preferences and needs. The cost will obviously be more with custom development since you're having a developer do the coding rather than simply purchasing a theme off the shelf, but consider the long term benefits. A custom site can be taylored to fit your exact needs and can make updating your site quicker and more enjoyable for you.</p>
        <h2>Menus</h2>
        <p><strong>What are menus?</strong> Menus are what help link your pages together. They can be custom or can be setup to mirror the hierarchy of your pages. You can create as many menus as you like for the main navigation, sub-menus, footer menus, or anywhere you need them on your site. If your theme has been created using dropdowns, these dropdown pages can be setup dynamically right in the Menus area. </p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage menus?</strong> Menus are located within the Appearance dropdown just under Widgets. On the menus page you're given the option to Create Menu. You'll first be asked to enter a name for your menu. You'll then be asked to add links to your menu from the options in the left hand side menus. You can add a page, a link, or a category to your menus. Once you've added one of these three, you'll see the menu you have created will be populated with the new link. Once you have created more than one link, you'll see you have the option to drag the links vertically to determine the order for your menu. You can also make a link a child page by indenting it under another link making that link it's parent. If your theme has added locations you'll see this located below the menu structure and typically gives you the option to make it a primary menu, sidebar menu or footer menu depening on where you would like the menu to be placed.</p>
        <p><strong>A few helpful tips.</strong> Horizontal menus typically only allow for so many links to be placed in them. Keep an eye on your site to make sure you don't add too many links that will cause your links to overflow your menu. If so, you can simply remove the links and figure out another way to structure your menu.</p>
        <h2>Wrap up</h2>
        <p>WordPress is full of great features and they keep getting better and better with each update. I tried to cover the topics I felt were most important with getting up a running quick. As features are added, changed or improved, I'll make it a point to write about these to address any big issues with WordPress.</p>
