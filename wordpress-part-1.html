        <p>I use WordPress as a Content Management System for 90% of the sites I build. It's very well put together and intuitive for both myself and my clients to update content. I typically have a training session with my clients after a website launch and I typically receive a lot of the same questions. I'm going to go over the main parts of WordPress quicky to explain what they are, how to manage them, and will throw in a tip or two as well. I'll break this up into two posts. The first post will cover posts, media, and pages. The second post, which will be next week, will cover plugins, themes, menus and comments.</p>
        <h2>Posts</h2>
        <p><strong>What is a post?</strong> Posts are frequently updated pieces of content that are typically related to a blog section of your site. Posts are displayed by date, can be placed into categories, and can be given tags which allow for easier searching. In a way, tags are another way to categorize your posts. A featured image can be added as well that will show up in your post, typically at the top depending on your theme. WordPress by default will display these posts on your home page unless you've designated a custom page for your home page. They typically display the title of the post, the author, the date, and what category they're in.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage my posts?</strong> Posts are the first item in the sidebar navigation in the dashboard just under the dashboard item. You can choose to view all, add new, create categories, or add tags. To create a new post, select Add New under posts. You'll begin by entering a title for your posts at the top of the page. After entering your title, you can then begin typing your post in the content editor below. I typically categorize, add tags, and add my featured image after I'm finished writing my post. When these things are complete, you'll see a Publish button at the top of the right hand menu. This will publish your post to your website with your current time and date. You also have the option to Preview, or Save Draft if you're still working on your post.</p>
        <p><strong>A few helpful tips.</strong> I sometimes want to change my publish date if I want my posts to be in a different order. There is an Edit link next to Publish immediately in the right hand menu that will allow you to change the date and time of your post. Change this and click okay to change these settings.
        </p>
        <h2>Media</h2>
        <p><strong>What is the media area?</strong> The media area is where you'll upload and store all of your images and documents. Here you can upload your media files before you create a post. You also have the option to upload to your Media area while you're creating a page or post. In a Page or Post you'll see an Add Media button above and to the left the content editor. Once you upload a media file, it will be given a unique link that you can use in your posts and pages. The link for this file will always stay the same unless you manully update it.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage my media?</strong> Media is the second item in the left hand sidebar just below posts. You have the option to view your entire library or add a new media file. If you click to view your library you'll see all of your posts organzied by date. Here you have the option to edit, delete or view any of the files. If you choose to Add New you'll have the option to drag-and-drop your file onto the browser window or select and browse to select your file. Once one of these are done, WordPress will upload your file to your site for you to use. At this point, you can add the media file by copying and pasting the link into your page or post, or adding it while creating your page or post.</p>
        <p><strong>A few helpful tips.</strong> When replacing or updating a file, be sure to delete your old file before you upload your replacement file. Even if your file has the same name, WordPress will keep both versions of the file in your Media Library. Keep this in mind if you have the need to frequently update your files.</p>
        <h2>Pages</h2>
        <p><strong>What are pages?</strong> The pages area is where you'll create the main content pages of your site. At first these will look very similar to posts but will not have options for categories or tags. Instead you'll have the option to select a parent page and a template for your page. Template pages typically are a home page or secondary page depending on what theme you're using. You also have the option of adding a featured image to pages as well. Pages for businesses are typically, about us, services, contact us, and a portfolio page if you're a designer like myself. These can be anything you want though and will depend on what business you have.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I manage my pages?</strong> Pages is the third item down in the left hand menu just below the Media link. These are very straight forward and will be very similar to posts to manage. You'll have the option to to view All Pages or Add New. Viewing All Pages will allow you to see all of the pages for your site in alphabetical order. From this page you have the options to edit, quick edit, trash or view. Edit will allow you to update the main content of the page. Quick edit allow you to quickly edit the parent page, template, or publish date or the page. Trash allows you to delete your page. Clicking view will open a new tab which will let you preview your page. Once you've clicked edit, you'll add the title of your page in the field at the top of the page. Once you've added your title you can then write the main content of your page in the content editor below. The content editor allows you to format your text, add links and image, and will also let you view your page in code view if you know HTML.</p>
        <p>Hopefully this gives you a quick understanding of the Post, Media and Page areas of the site. Next week I'll be covering the plugin, theme, menu and comment areas of WordPress. </p>
