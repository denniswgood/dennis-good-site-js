        <p><strong>Why send a newsletter?</strong> There are a lot of reasons I take the time each month to send a newsletter to my clients and friends. One primary reasons is to provide material that will improve their productivity or helpful information about operating their business. Before sending out each newsletter, I ask myself if the information I created will help someone be better at what they do. If my answer is no, I don't send it. The purpose of my business is to provide services that help businesses run smoother. This typically comes in the form of a logo design, new website or email marketing campaign.</p>
        <h2>Here is a list of goals for each of my newsletters:</h2>
        <ul class="with-bullets">
          <li>Include relevant, helpful information for my subscribers.</li>
          <li>Keep it short enough to read within 1-2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Include link to blog subscribe form.</li>
          <li>Make it personal.</li>
          <li>Include an offer for my services.</li>
          <li>Include a little info about me.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't make the mistake?</strong> Creating a newsletter may seem easy enough, but you may not be doing the most important thing with your newsletter. Making it something your subscribers want to read. I subscribe to a lot of newsletters from other designers and developers and a lot of them get it right. But some do not. Some do not pay attention to who they're actually sending to. If you're a web designer, does your subscriber list include designers, developers and coders? Probably not. Your subscribers are probably customers or clients you have worked with in the past. So, if you're writing about tips and tricks about CSS or the latest HTML 5 trends chances are your subscribers are not going to read this. They're going to be more concerned with their industry issues or general business topics like finance, productivity, and management. Take the time to put yourself in their shoes and write about topics that address their issues rather than yours. It's easiest to write about what you do, but chances are your clients and customers are going to be interested.</p>
        <p><strong>Topics to cover?</strong> So that leads me to the question. What is it that your customers want to read about? This depends on what kind of products or services you offer. If you teach people how to make homemade lamps, your customers will want to hear about the latest color trends, or what tools work best. If you give guitar lessons, your customers will want to know where to buy music, how to care for their guitar, or how to get their first gig. For myself, I provide print and web design to small business owners mostly. Their interested in how they can cut time creating proposals, useful tools for managing their finances, and how to get work done. You probably get the idea, but the important thing is to make your topics interesting and relevant to your customers, not yourself. If you don't know what these topics are all you have to do is ask your customers. You'll be surprised how many questions they have that you'll probably have the answers for. Keep a running list of topics you can cover and write about them. You'll have your clients and customers thanking you.</p>
        <p><strong>How often to send it?</strong> Frequency is another big topic with email marketing. Are your blog posts super relevant to your customers? If so, they probably won't mind getting it in their inbox once a week. If it's not going to provide value to what they're doing right that minute, you may want to send your newsletters less frequently, say once a month. It depends on what kind of content you're creating and how relevant it's going to be. The rule of thumb used to be once a month, but we've gotten smarter over time and have started creating content that people will use. Another option is to give your subscribers a choice on how frequently they would like to receive your newsletters. Some may prefer once a week, some may prefer once a month. If you're creating content once a week, this may not be a bad idea so you're not continually filling up your subscriber's inboxes.</p>
        <p>It's important to put yourself if your customer's shoes. Ask them what they want to read and ask them how often they want it. They're the ones who will be generating referrals, coming to you with repeat work and helping your grown your business. So take care of your subscribers and let them know that you're listening.</p>
